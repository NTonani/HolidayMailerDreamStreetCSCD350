Mailer
===============================
Authors: Nathan Tonani and Leland Burlingame

Simple GUI project made in C# using VS/.NET. The application allows the user to send emails to any contact(s), including contacts they add to their account, using any email they have stored with their account. The application only sends email, it does not receive.
