Welcome to the Dream Street Holiday Mailer!

To compile, simpy open 'HolidayMailerCSCD350.sln'. If for some unseen reason you are missing a SQLite .dll, add a reference to the sqlite4.5.1 folder from within this directory.To use, start by creating your own account. After creating an account, enter in login credentials and you're in! From within the main form, you're able to add/remove/edit contacts, edit user account information from the drop down in the upper right, sort, search, attach files, and send mail. I suggest adding some contacts, adding a few more emails of yours to your profile, and sending an email or two.

Enjoy!
